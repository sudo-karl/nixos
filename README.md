# Hello there
to use this config, copy the entire folder from the repo into a folder called nixos in your home directory and add a wallpaper called nix.png into ~/Pictures or some features may not work. Replace the hardware config with your hardware-config file from /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix and rebuild your system using the command "sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/nixos#default". If the rebuild was successfull this command should now be available under the alias "rebuild". ylYou may need to add the line "nix.settings.experimental-features = ["nix-command" "flakes"]"; in your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix if flakes dont work. After adding the line run "sudo nixos-rebuild switch" and then run the first command again.
... and of course change instances of my name to yours.
